title: Jacobians
abstract: |
    Jacobians map joint velocities to translational and angular (Cartesian) velocities. The 
    _angular Cartesian velocities_ are commonly referred to as _body rates_: $p$ is the angular
    rate about the $X$ axis (roll), $q$ is the angular rate about the $Y$ axis (pitch), 
    and $r$ is the angular rate about the $Z$ axis (yaw).

## Derivations

The translation and rotation Jacobians can be derived using two methods: direct differentiation,
and the cross-product method.

$$
\begin{bmatrix} \dot{x} \\ \dot{y} \\ \dot{z} \end{bmatrix} = J_T \begin{bmatrix} \dot{q_1} \\ \dot{q_2} \\ ... \\ \dot{q_n} \end{bmatrix}
$$ {#eq-trans-jac}

$$
\begin{bmatrix} p \\ q \\ r \end{bmatrix} = J_\Omega \begin{bmatrix} \dot{q_1} \\ \dot{q_2} \\ ... \\ \dot{q_n} \end{bmatrix}
$$ {#eq-rot-jac}

## Direct Differentiation

### Translation Jacobian

$$
{}^0J_T = \frac{\partial}{\partial \overrightarrow{q}} {}^0P_T
$$

## Cross Product Method
