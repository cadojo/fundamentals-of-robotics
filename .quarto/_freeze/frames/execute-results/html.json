There are two ways to describe multi-axis rotations: fixed axes, and euler (rotating) axes.\n\n## Why Rotations\n\nWe use rotations to answer two different questions...\n\n1.  Given $P$, what are the coordinates of **that same point** relative to $F_j$?\n    -   Answer looks like: ${}^j(P_0) = R_j P$\n2.  Given $P$, what are the coordinates of a point **in** $F_2$ that are rotated about some axis?\n    -   Answer looks like: ${}^2(P) = R_i P$\n\nHow can we reconcile this?\n\n-   $R_j \\equiv R_i^T$\n\n## Rotation Matrices\n\nRelating reference frames requires many (somewhat arbitrary) definitions. We may choose to relate frames by rotating axes, or fixed axes. We may choose to change the basis of a three-valued vector through rotation, or we may choose to rotate a three-valued vector in its original reference frame. For these reasons, you may see two different definitions of rotation matrices about principle axes. Both definitions are the transpose --- and due to orthonormality, the inverse --- of one another.\n\nThe definitions below are the principle rotation matrices we will use moving forward. The following matrices rotate a three-valued vector by an angle of $\\theta$ about each of the three basis vectors; see Equations 2.77, 2.78, and 2.79 in Craig's Introduction to Robotics [@craig].\n\n\n\n$$\nR_x(\\theta) = \\begin{bmatrix} \n    1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & \\cos{\\theta} & -\\sin{\\theta} \\\\\n    0 & \\sin{\\theta} &  \\cos{\\theta}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$ {#eq-rx}\n\n$$\nR_y(\\theta) = \\begin{bmatrix} \n     \\cos{\\theta} & 0 & \\sin{\\theta} \\\\\n     0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n    -\\sin{\\theta} & 0 & \\cos{\\theta}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$ {#eq-ry}\n\n$$\nR_z(\\theta) = \\begin{bmatrix} \n    \\cos{\\theta} & -\\sin{\\theta} & 0 \\\\\n    \\sin{\\theta} &  \\cos{\\theta} & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$ {#eq-rz}\n\n## Euler Axis Rotations\n\nThere are many ways to describe rotations about multiple axes. One way is to apply a sequence of rotations about principle axes, applying each rotation to the preceding *intermediate* frame. This technique is known as *euler* sequence rotations.\n\nYou might say: to get frame $B$, rotate frame $A$ by $\\theta_1$ degrees about frame $A$'s $X$ axis, then rotate **that intermediate frame** $\\theta_2$ degrees about the intermediate frame's $Y$ axis, etc.\n\nEuler ZYX: $R_z(\\theta_3) R_y(\\theta_2) R_x(\\theta_1)$\n\n## Fixed Axis Rotations\n\nFixed XYZ: $R_x(\\theta_1) R_y(\\theta_2) R_z(\\theta_3)$\n\n## Translations & Rotations (Transformations)\n\n",
